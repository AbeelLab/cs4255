## Preparation
### Computer requirements
You need to bring your own laptop. 

Requirements: 
* Python 3.6+
* At least 20Gb free disk-space

Desired (but not required): 
* Linux kernel system (Mac, Windows 10 or Linux based OS)

### Course book
In this course we will cover Chapters 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10 from the book ["Bioinformatics Algorithms - an active learning approach"][book]. Having the related chapters at hand during the programming exercises will prove very helpful.

## During the course

### Course material

- [The Brightspace page][bs] will be used to distribute lecture slides that cannot yet be shared publicly
- We will also be using [the Github page](https://abeellab.github.io/cs4255/).

### Exercises 
Exercises are hosted on Rosalind. You first need to [enroll in the course](http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/9c5fec1841/).

After you have enrolled in the course, you can also [directly access it][ex]. Each Monday you will be working on the exercises of the lectures from the previous week (Tuesday and Thursday). 

### Project
You should select two research papers out of the list below to implement in your project:
- [Minimap-Miniasm][minimap]
- [BWA-MEM][bwa]
- [FastTree-Pindel][fastpin]

Your project grades will be the 40% of your final grade. You are expected to submit your project by week 8.

### Exam
Exam grades will make up the 60% of your final grade.
