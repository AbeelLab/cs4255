# CS4255: Algorithms for sequence-based bioinformatics (2019/20 Q2) #


The first lecture will take place on November 12. In the first lecture we will go over some logistics, including project planning and assignment, and setting the exam appointment. Attendance during the first lecture is highly recommended.

**The exercise sessions scheduled for November 11 will not take place.**

* Linux kernel system (Mac, Windows 10 or Linux based OS)

### Course book
In this course we will cover Chapters 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10 from the book ["Bioinformatics Algorithms - an active learning approach"][book]. Having the related chapters at hand during the programming exercises will prove very helpful.

## During the course

### Course material

- [The Brightspace page][bs] will be used to distribute lecture slides that cannot yet be shared publicly
- We will also be using [the Github page](https://abeellab.github.io/cs4255/).

### Exercises 
Exercises are hosted on Rosalind. You first need to [enroll in the course](http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/9c5fec1841/).

After you have enrolled in the course, you can also [directly access it][ex]. Each Monday you will be working on the exercises of the lectures from the previous week (Tuesday and Thursday). 

### Project
You should select two research papers out of the list below to implement in your project:
- Mininap/miniasm
- BLAST
- Magnolya
- BWA-MEM
- FastTree
- Pindel

Your project grades will be the 40% of your final grade. You are expected to submit your project by week 8.

### Exam
Exam grades will make up the 60% of your final grade.
You can find more detailed instructions for the project [here][proj].
